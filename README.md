# Pewlet-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview
The Purpose of this analysis was to determine what employees are retiring soon and what departments they are in so that the company can better plan for the future. 
# Results
* The department with the highest number of future retirees is the Senior Engineer department.
* The department with the lowest number of future retirees is the management department.
* The company has more Senior Staff retiring than regular Staff.
* The company has more Senior Engineers retiring than Engineers and more Engineers retiring than Assistant Engineers.
# Summary
The company has 67,367 jobs that will need to be filled in the near future by a combination of outside hiring and internal promotion. 
Given the company has the highest number of employees reitring in senior positions, it currently has the ability to train and mentor the next generation f employees but this process should begin soon. The company does not have enough lower level postions to fulfill all of the upcoming retiring senior positions though so outside hires will be needed at some point.
